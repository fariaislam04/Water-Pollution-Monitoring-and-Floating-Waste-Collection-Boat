Another thing is needed to download to run this script which link is given below. Remember to name this file as "yolov3.weights".

link: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

This file couldn't included because of large size.

Another important fact is, in python script, the path should be absolute path according to your device folder.

Thank you. :D
